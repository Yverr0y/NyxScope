# NyxScope

**A multi-protocol SDR receiver for Windows. Native decoders for the protocols that matter, plus a curated toolkit for everything else.**

NyxScope is a Rust/Tauri application that decodes most of its digital protocols natively — P25 Phase 1 and Phase 2 voice, EDACS and NXDN control channels, ADS-B, AIS, ACARS, POCSAG, FLEX, LoRa CSS PHY + LoRaWAN MAC, Morse, RDS, CTCSS/DCS, signal classification — in-process, no sidecar. For protocols where a mature open-source decoder already exists, NyxScope bundles it (`dsd-fme`, `multimon-ng`, `rtl_433`, `nrsc5`, `direwolf`, `dumpvdl2`, `dump978`, `rs41mod`) so the app installs with zero `PATH` wrangling. You get spectrum and waterfall, multiple concurrent VFOs, trunked-radio following, digital voice, aviation and marine tracking, paging, ISM sensors, HD Radio, and transcription, in one binary.

## What NyxScope decodes natively

Most of NyxScope's digital decode work runs in native Rust inside the application — no sidecar, no IPC on the hot loop, no upstream tool to install or version-match:

- **P25 Phase 1 voice** with soft-NID and best-effort IMBE FEC — 94–96% frame recovery on weak signals where stock decoders get zero syncs. The IMBE codec itself runs in an isolated `sdr-imbe-helper` subprocess against `mbelib-neo`.
- **P25 Phase 2 TDMA voice** — π/4 DQPSK demod with Gardner timing recovery, 21-dibit TDMA sync, dual-slot extraction, AMBE+2 decode.
- **EDACS control channel** — 9600 baud GMSK, BCH(40,28), ESK auto-detect, Standard and EA mode (auto-detected from site-ID pattern), with voice following on the data channels.
- **NXDN48 control channel** — 4FSK demod, FSW sync, PN 9,5 scrambler, K=5 Viterbi FEC, CRC-16 / CRC-6 protected CAC and SACCH frames.
- **ADS-B (1090 MHz)** — native Mode S extended-squitter decode straight off the IQ stream.
- **AIS (162 MHz)** — native dual-channel GMSK decoder.
- **ACARS** — native MSK decoder with multi-channel VFO scheduling.
- **POCSAG 512 / 1200 / 2400** — in-process, no `multimon-ng` subprocess on paging-only ranges.
- **FLEX 1600 / 3200 / 6400** — in-process, same path.
- **LoRa CSS PHY** — chirp / dechirp / FFT decoder with parallel SF7–12 paths per channel, Hamming and CRC handling, and LoRaWAN MAC parsing (DevAddr, FCnt, FPort, MType) across nine regional plans. Also decodes **Meshtastic** (node info, text, telemetry, position) and **MeshCore** (adverts, group text), feeding the LoRa-tab node view.
- **Morse / CW** with on-card readout.
- **CTCSS / DCS** — Goertzel-based CTCSS (50 tones, median noise-floor gating) and Golay(23,12) DCS (83 codes, every alignment and polarity).
- **RDS** for WFM (station name, RadioText, PTY, TP/TA).
- **Bluetooth LE advertising scanner** — native GFSK decode on the three 2.4 GHz advertising channels (37/38/39), with channel-seeded whitening and CRC-24 validated against real packets. Rich advertisement parsing (flags, service UUIDs, TX power, appearance, manufacturer, iBeacon/Eddystone), a device table keyed by MAC with **IEEE OUI vendor lookup** (~40k orgs), device-type icons, a type filter, and a signal meter. A dedicated scan mode cycles the channels; a normal 2.4 GHz scan also surfaces BLE opportunistically. Needs a 2.4 GHz SDR (HackRF / PlutoSDR / Airspy).
- **Signal classification (AMC)** — labels FSK / GFSK / OOK / OFDM and friends from IQ alone.
- **Protocol identification** — IQ-fingerprint-based POCSAG/FLEX disambiguation, before any decoder is run.
- **Multi-stage IQ decimation pipeline** for NFM/AM — VFO does IQ→IQ→FM demod instead of IQ→FM→audio decim, recovering ~14 dB of pager-sideband sensitivity.
- **Integer CIC + FM demod pipeline** for digital voice — the path that makes DSD actually sync on real signals (matches `rtl_fm` round-trip exactly).
- **Native HD Radio host-side resampler** — bit-accurate cubic Hermite + Blackman LPF, lets the `nrsc5` sidecar run on whatever sample rate the SDR will give us.
- **Multi-SDR registry and tabbed UI (preview)** — the backend registry manages multiple SDRs in parallel with per-slot scan / VFO / message streams; the `SlotTabs` strip appears once a second SDR is connected. Single-SDR users see no UI change. Treated as preview until a Pro License SKU ships.
- **Adaptive auto-squelch** with one-shot calibration and continuous noise-floor tracking.
- **HTTP control surface** on port 8765 — JSON API for status, audio streaming, IQ streaming, debug stats, message tails, and headless operation. Always-on, separate from the Tauri GUI.

## Bundled decoders

For protocols where a mature open-source decoder already exists, NyxScope bundles it as a sidecar so the app installs with zero `PATH` configuration. Each sidecar runs as a separate process — not statically linked into the main binary — so license obligations stay scoped to each component. To keep the base installer lean, the heavier and satellite-focused sidecars download on demand (SHA-256 verified) from the in-app **Feature Manager** the first time you need them.

If a decode is wrong inside one of the bundled tools, the fix usually belongs **upstream** with the project that owns that decoder. Bugs in NyxScope's UI, native decoders, scanner engine, or sidecar wiring belong here. We do not maintain forks of bundled tools.

## License and source code

- **The NyxScope application is proprietary.** It is governed by [`eula.md`](./eula.md), not an OSI-approved open-source license.
- **Bundled decoders remain under their upstream licenses** (see [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](./THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and the [`LICENSES/`](./LICENSES/) directory). Each runs as a separate sidecar process — not statically linked into the main binary — so license obligations stay scoped to each component.
- **GPL containment.** The IMBE / AMBE / AMBE+2 vocoder (`mbelib-neo`) runs in a dedicated `sdr-imbe-helper` subprocess that talks to the main app over stdin/stdout. That helper is GPL-2.0-or-later; the main binary contains no GPL object code and stays governed solely by the EULA.
- **Per GPL §3(a), exact corresponding source for every bundled GPL- and LGPL-licensed component is published per release at:**
  - https://i-c.biz/sources/v{version}/
  - Each release directory contains the exact source matching the binaries in that installer, indexed by NyxScope version. A written request on physical media is also available — see EULA §9.3.
- **Network behaviour is documented.** The full privacy policy lives in [`privacy.md`](./privacy.md). In short: no listening data ever leaves the machine; outbound traffic is limited to a periodic license heartbeat (key id + hashed hardware fingerprint, no audio/IQ/messages), opt-in crash reports, and the on-click lookups described below.

## What it does

- **Live spectrum and GPU waterfall** with peak picking, hover tooltips, right-click tune-to, and one-click skip from peaks. The waterfall renders in WebGL — smooth and interpolated, with the history scrolled and colour-mapped on the graphics card (it falls back to a CPU renderer when WebGL isn't available).
- **IQ-recording playback** — load a saved capture (`.cf32` / `.cs16` / `.cu8` / `.fc32` / `.sc16` / `.raw`) as a playback "device" and run every native decoder, VFO, and protocol panel against it as if it were live.
- **Multiple concurrent VFOs** with mini-waterfalls (centered on the channel and scaled to its bandwidth) and independent audio per channel.
- **Adaptive auto-squelch** that tracks the noise floor with one-shot and continuous modes.
- **Auto-identify digital protocol** — point at an unknown digital signal and the app cycles through DSD modes and picks the best match.
- **Signal classification** that labels the modulation (FSK, GFSK, OOK, OFDM, …) from IQ.
- **Bluetooth LE scanner** — discover nearby BLE advertisers (phones, watches, earbuds, beacons, sensors, trackers) on 2.4 GHz, with vendor names, device-type icons, signal strength, and full advertisement detail.
- **Quick Modes** — one-click presets for ADS-B, AIS, ACARS, VDL2, APRS, pagers, ISM sensors, and radiosondes.
- **Channel-bank scanning** with priority, skip lists, and import from CHIRP / RadioReference / FCC.
- **Live tracking map** for ADS-B, AIS, APRS, and radiosondes, side-by-side with the data table — never a blocking modal.
- **HTTP audio streaming** so any channel can be listened to from another device on the LAN.
- **IQ streaming** in an `rtl_tcp`-compatible format for chaining into external tools.
- **Per-VFO recording** — WAV and IQ, with VAD/VOX triggers, pre/post-record buffers, and notes that travel with the file.
- **Per-band scanner overrides** — squelch, hold time, dwell, and digital-detect settings remembered per band.

![NyxScope Bluetooth LE scanner — discovered devices listed by MAC with vendor names, device-type icons, a signal meter, advertising channel and packet count, plus a per-device detail view](screenshots/BLE_Scan.png)

*The BLE tab lists every advertising device deduped by MAC — address, name and vendor (from the manufacturer ID or the IEEE OUI registry), a category icon, a signal bar, the advertising channel and packet count — with sortable/searchable columns and full per-device advertisement detail (services, iBeacon/Eddystone, raw hex).*

![NyxScope RadioReference import — bringing a trunked system's talkgroups and frequencies straight into a channel bank](screenshots/RadioReferenceImport.png)

*Channel banks can be populated by importing directly from RadioReference (and CHIRP / FCC), pulling in a system's frequencies and talkgroups so you're scanning in seconds.*

## Protocol coverage

![NyxScope Trunk Discovery tab — automatically surfacing candidate control-channel frequencies with an individual-frequency filter](screenshots/TrunkDiscovery.png)

*Trunk Discovery watches a band and surfaces the control-channel candidates it finds, so you can identify and add a trunked system without knowing its frequencies up front.*

### Digital voice

P25 (Phase 1 & 2), DMR, NXDN48, NXDN96, D-STAR, Yaesu System Fusion, M17, ProVoice — manual mode selection on a locked frequency, or hit **Identify** and let the app pick.

### Aviation and marine

![NyxScope in ADS-B mode — aircraft on a live map with altitude-coloured trails, a sortable aircraft list, and a detail card showing registration, type and operator](screenshots/ADSB_popout.png)

*ADS-B 1090: aircraft plotted on a live map with altitude-coloured trails, next to a sortable list and a detail card — ICAO hex, callsign, altitude, speed, heading, and one-click metadata lookup for registration, type and operator. The message panel can pop out into its own window.*

*ACARS: NyxScope schedules VFOs across the standard VHF ACARS channels and decodes messages natively — registration, flight ID, the 2-character label with its description, and the message body.*

### Satellite & L-band

A suite of space and L-band receivers (downloaded on demand from the Feature Manager). Most need an **L-band antenna / LNA** and a clear sky view, and several are still being hardened against weak signals — see the BETA note.

![NyxScope decoding Iridium L-band bursts — frame types (IRA, IBC, IDA…) in a live timeline with a satellite/Ring-Alert view](screenshots/Iridium_Lband.png)

*Iridium (1.6 GHz): NyxScope's native burst decoder classifies and parses Iridium frames (Ring Alert / IRA satellite overhead, broadcast, data) into a live, filterable timeline, with a quick-start preset and map view.*

![NyxScope GPS L1 acquisition — detected satellites with their PRN, SNR and Doppler, for validating an L-band antenna and sky view](screenshots/GPS%20L1%20Satellite%20Detector.png)

*GNSS L1 acquisition: NyxScope acquires visible GPS (and GLONASS) satellites with per-PRN SNR and Doppler — a quick way to confirm an L-band antenna and clear sky view before chasing weaker satellite signals.*

### Paging and sensors

![NyxScope decoding FLEX paging traffic — decoded messages with capcodes and timestamps alongside the spectrum](screenshots/PagerReception.png)

*FLEX paging: NyxScope's native FLEX/POCSAG decoders surface messages with capcodes, timestamps and content. A dedicated wideband pager-monitor mode can watch many paging channels at once across the band.*

*Quick Modes: one click sets the frequency, sample rate, decoder and view for a common task — no manual tuning.*

| Preset | Frequency | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADS-B 1090 | 1090 MHz | Aircraft on a live map |
| AIS 162 | 161.975 / 162.025 MHz | Vessels on a live map |
| ACARS 130 | 129–131 MHz | Aircraft messages and flight data |
| VDL2 137 | 136.975 MHz | Modern VHF Data Link aircraft messaging |
| APRS 144.390 | 144.390 MHz | Amateur packet positions and weather |
| Pagers 929–932 | 929–932 MHz | POCSAG and FLEX pager traffic |
| 433 Sensors | 433 MHz ISM | European wireless sensors |
| 915 Sensors | 902–928 MHz | US smart meters, weather, security |
| Radiosonde 400–406 | 400–406 MHz | Weather balloon telemetry |

## Hardware support

Bring your own SDR. The popular ones work natively:

| Hardware | Frequency Range |
| --- | --- |
| RTL-SDR (and clones) | 24 MHz – 1.766 GHz |
| HackRF One | 1 MHz – 6 GHz |
| Airspy R2 / Mini | 24 MHz – 1.8 GHz |
| SDRplay (RSP series) | 1 kHz – 2 GHz |
| LimeSDR / LimeSDR Mini | 100 kHz – 3.8 GHz |
| PlutoSDR / Pluto+ | 70 MHz – 6 GHz (USB or Ethernet) |
| Network SDRs | `rtl_tcp` servers, auto-discovered on the LAN |

RTL-SDR devices need WinUSB / libusb drivers — install via [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/). HackRF, Airspy, bladeRF, SDRplay, Fobos, and PlutoSDR work via SoapySDR; install the matching Soapy module and vendor driver.

## Editions

NyxScope is **fully functional for free** — every decoder works (ADS-B, UAT, AIS, ACARS, P25/DMR/NXDN/EDACS voice, VDL2, HD Radio, APRS, radiosonde, LoRa, ISM sensors, POCSAG/FLEX paging, CTCSS/DCS, RDS, signal classification), along with trunked-radio following, audio and IQ recording, and Whisper transcription. The free tier runs up to **3 concurrent VFOs** and applies modest quotas to saved recordings, transcriptions, and pager messages.

A **license** lifts those limits and adds the infrastructure features: **unlimited VFOs**, HTTP and RTL-TCP audio streaming, unlimited recording and transcription, and built-in access to the **i-c.biz FCC frequency-lookup database** (no separate API key). A trial of the licensed features starts automatically on first install — no card required. Licenses are bound to a hardware fingerprint and transferable on request. See the License dialog in-app for activation details.

The license model is described in detail in [`eula.md`](./eula.md).

## Privacy and data

- **Audio, IQ, recordings, transcripts, and the spectrum waterfall stay on your machine.** None of it is ever transmitted.
- **Local Whisper** transcription is fully offline — audio never leaves the machine.
- **Cloud transcription** (OpenAI Whisper API) is opt-in **per channel**. The app never sends audio without an explicit Enable click. The endpoint URL is user-configurable; the OpenAI default ships disabled until you paste in your own API key.
- **License heartbeat** — Trial and Licensed installs check the license server every few hours to confirm the key hasn't been revoked. The ping carries your numeric key id and a hashed hardware fingerprint. No listening data is included.
- **Crash reports** are opt-in. After a panic, the next launch shows the full report inline and nothing is sent unless you click **Send**. Reports are double-redacted (license keys, tokens, IPs, and home paths replaced) before transmission.
- **FCC database and aircraft lookups** only happen when you click **Lookup** or **Auto-enrich** — see the section below.

Full plain-language details and opt-out steps live in [`privacy.md`](./privacy.md), shipped inside every release artifact. Online version: [i-c.biz/policies/privacy.php](https://i-c.biz/policies/privacy.php).

## Online lookups (optional)

NyxScope can enrich what it shows you with two optional online lookups. Both are gated to Trial / Licensed tiers and both can be turned off in Settings. Free-tier users can perform the same lookups manually at [i-c.biz/db](https://i-c.biz/db) at no charge.

![The i-c.biz/db web lookup — a self-hosted mirror of the FCC ULS and OpenSky aircraft databases, searchable by frequency or ICAO hex](screenshots/databasewebsite.png)

*The same FCC ULS and aircraft data NyxScope uses for in-app enrichment is browsable for free at [i-c.biz/db](https://i-c.biz/db) — search by frequency to find the licensee, callsign, service and expiry, or by ICAO hex for aircraft registration and operator.*

- **FCC ULS frequency lookup** — when you right-click a frequency in any data tab, NyxScope can query [i-c.biz/db](https://i-c.biz/db), a self-hosted mirror of the FCC's Universal Licensing System, to identify the licensee, callsign, service code, and license expiry. Data source: the FCC ULS public bulk database (US Federal Government, public domain). Endpoint: `https://i-c.biz/db/api/v2/search/frequencies`.
- **Aircraft metadata lookup** — when an ADS-B (1090) or UAT (978) target appears with an ICAO hex code, NyxScope can resolve the registration, type, and operator via a self-hosted mirror of the OpenSky aircraft database. Endpoint: `https://i-c.biz/db/api/v2/aircraft`. The OpenSky aircraft database is community-maintained and free to redistribute under its own terms.

Both endpoints accept only the lookup key (frequency range or ICAO hex). No audio, no IQ, no positional or talkgroup data is sent. The endpoint URL is overridable in Settings — point it at your own mirror or disable lookups entirely.

## Install

**Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit).** Download the latest `.exe` installer from [Releases](https://github.com/ICBizLabs/NyxScope/releases/latest) and run it. The installer bundles every decoder sidecar plus the runtime DLLs they need.

NyxScope is currently Windows-only. 

## System requirements

- 64-bit Windows 10 or 11
- 4 GB RAM minimum; 8 GB recommended for heavy multi-VFO use with transcription
- Compatible SDR hardware (see table above)
- ~500 MB disk for the app, plus room for recordings

## A note from the developer

The last couple of releases were messy — sorry about that. I'll try to do
better. With all the feedback we're now receiving, the bugs should get squashed
fairly quickly.

And please don't rush to purchase. Make sure NyxScope is a good fit for you, and
that you won't mind dealing with beta releases that may occasionally break
things. I'm only one person, so without testers there's no way I can find every
bug — as I'm now seeing. Thanks for your help.

## Community and support

## Acknowledgments

NyxScope ships its own decoders for most digital protocols and integrates a curated set of established open-source tools for the rest. Thanks to the maintainers of `dsd-fme`, `mbelib-neo`, `rtl_433`, `multimon-ng`, `nrsc5`, `direwolf`, `dumpvdl2`, `dump978`, `rs41mod`, `inmarsat-sniffer`, and `SatDump`, and to the Rust, Tauri, and Svelte projects — the bundled-tools side of NyxScope rests on their work. The full list of upstream libraries lives in [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](./THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

If you find NyxScope useful, please also consider supporting the upstream projects.
